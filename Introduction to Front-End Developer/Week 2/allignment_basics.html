            <p>
                Text alignment can be set to left, right, center and justify.
                The justify alignment spreads the text out so that every line
                of the text has the same width.
                The default alignment is left for languages that are left-to-right
                such as English. For right-to-left languages such as Arabic,
                the default alignment is right.

                Aligning an HTML element is done by changing the properties of its
                box model and how it impacts the document flow.

            <div class="child">
                <h3>
                    HTML Element Center Alignment
                </h3>
                <p>
                    To center align an element, you set a width on the element and push
                    its margins out to fill the remaining available space of the parent
                    element as in the following HTML structure:
                    In your CSS, you'll set the parent element to have a red border to 
                    visualize the space it occupies:
                    The child element will have a width equal to 50% of the parent 
                    element with a padding of 20 pixels. Note that padding: 20px is 
                    shorthand for setting the padding top, bottom, left and right to
                    20px. To visualize the space it occupies, set the border to green:
                </p>
            </div> 
        </div>
        <div class="parent2">
            <img src="photo.png" class="child2">If you want to align an inline element like img, you will need to change it to a block-level element. Similar to the div example, you add the img to a parent element: The CSS rule then changes the img element to a block-level element and sets its margin to auto:
        </div>  
        <div class="parent3">
            <img src="photo.png" class="child3"> HTML Element Left / Right Alignment The two most common ways to left and right align elements are to use the float property and the position property. The position property has several value options that impact how the element displays in the document flow. You'll explore how to use the position property later on. For now, let's focus on the float property. The float property sets an element's position relative to the text content within a parent element. Text will wrap around the element. In the following example, the image will be aligned to the right of the div element. The text content will wrap around the image:
          </div>  
    </body>
